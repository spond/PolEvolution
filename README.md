POL EVOLUTION
-------------

This collection of HyPhy (http://www.hyphy.org) scripts perform sequence analysis
on collections of longitudinal HIV-1 pol (bulk) sequence isolates, sampled from
multiple individuals at multiple time points. More details of the analysis can 
be found in this paper: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23840830

USAGE
-----

	TN93dist <FASTA file> <output file> <distance thershold> < how to handle ambiguities; one of RESOLVE, AVERAGE, SKIP> <output format; one of CSV, HYPHY> [BOOTSTRAP 0 or 1].

Try it from using the example file in 'data' by typing 

	TN93dist data/test.fas data/test.dst 0.05 RESOLVE CSV

Output (all written to stderr, so can be redirected)

Example:

	Read 8 sequences of length 1320
	Will perform 28 pairwise distance calculations
	Progress:      100% (       7 links found)
	Maximum distance = 0.0890019


ARGUMENTS
---------

	FASTA file 		: <required> 
			 		path to the input FASTA file.
					All sequences must be aligned and have the same length. 
					Only IUPAC characters are recognized (e.g. no ~)

	output file     : <required> 
					path to the output file, which will be either 
					CSV or HyPhy matrix format (see output format)

	distance thershold 	: <required> 
						a real-valued number between 0 and 1. 
						Only pairwise distances <= this number will be written out. 
						This is very useful for rapid processing of very large aligments
						when one is looking for epidemiological linkage
					  
	how to handle ambiguitie : <required> 
							how to count ambiguities when computing the matrix of pairwise letter counts.
							One of three values
								RESOLVE: if one character is resolved (e.g. A,C,G,T) and the other is an ambiguity, 
									try to resolve the ambiguity to maximize identity, e.g. 
									A-R will map to A-A, A-Y will map to 0.5 of A-C and 0.5 of A-T
									if both characters are ambiguous, then consider all possible resolutions equiprobably
									R-R will map to 0.25 A-A and 0.5 A-G and 0.25 G-G
								AVERAGE: consider all possible resolutions equiprobably, e.g.
									A-R will map to 0.5 A-A and 0.5 A-G
								SKIP	: do not include any sites with ambiguities in distance calculations
							 
	output format : <required> 
					what to write to output file. One of two values:
						CSV: Sequence1, Sequence 2, Distances (only those below distance thershold written)
							in the example above
							 
							Example:
								Seq1,Seq2,Distance
								B_US_83_RF_ACC_M17451,B_US_86_JRFL_ACC_U63632,0.048328
								B_US_86_JRFL_ACC_U63632,B_US_90_WEAU160_ACC_U21135,0.0408994
								D_CD_83_ELI_ACC_K03454,D_CD_83_NDK_ACC_M27323,0.0287246
								D_CD_83_NDK_ACC_M27323,D_CD_84_84ZR085_ACC_U88822,0.0491974
								B_FR_83_HXB2_ACC_K03455,B_US_83_RF_ACC_M17451,0.045156
								B_FR_83_HXB2_ACC_K03455,B_US_86_JRFL_ACC_U63632,0.0296218
								B_FR_83_HXB2_ACC_K03455,B_US_90_WEAU160_ACC_U21135,0.0327566

						HYPHY: write the full HyPhy matrix with distances above threshold replaced with 100
							   and sequences ordered as in input file
								   
							Example:
								{
								{0,0.045156,0.0296218,0.0327566,100,100,100,100}
								{0.045156,0,0.048328,100,100,100,100,100}
								{0.0296218,0.048328,0,0.0408994,100,100,100,100}
								{0.0327566,100,0.0408994,0,100,100,100,100}
								{100,100,100,100,0,0.0287246,100,100}
								{100,100,100,100,0.0287246,0,0.0491974,100}
								{100,100,100,100,100,0.0491974,0,100}
								{100,100,100,100,100,100,100,0}
								}


	BOOTSTRAP :	<optional> 
					if 1, then the sequences will be bootstrapped (sites drawn with replacement) once.
					this is useful to call multiple times for simulation purposes
	
					Example:
						TN93dist data/test.fas data/test.dst 0.05 RESOLVE CSV 1
				
							(the ouput will be different nearly every time the program is run)
							---
							Read 8 sequences of length 1320
							Will perform 28 pairwise distance calculations
							Progress:      100% (       9 links found)
							Maximum distance = 0.110232
